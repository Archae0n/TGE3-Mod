[h1]Techs[/h1]
All modules have their own technologies. Some are rare. Tier 6 to Tier 10 modules come after their vanilla variants and techs, so these are very much late game technologies. 
For those with Utopia DLC: The final tier weapon technologies have a low spawn chance unless you build the science nexus! 
For those without Utopia DLC: the final tier weapon technologies will show up normally.
The science nexus increases the chance advanced component & weapons technologies show up by 500%

Recomended Addon Mod: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1377634390] Core Game Mechanics: Debris [/url]
[i]ExNihil's Debris mod fixes/boosts the way debris works in Vanilla. Debris that you research will give you ALL the technologies that lead up to what's in the debris, not just the latest version.[/i]
	
[h1]Ship Power Stations for other mods.?[/h1]
Feel free to make a compatibility patch. I sadly don't have the time. 

[h1]KNOWN ISSUES [/h1]
** Some modules do not correctly apply their stats to the ship builder UI. This is an issue with the game and ui that I cannot fix myself.
** Auto-upgrade between vanilla modules and my modules does not work (yet). I'd need to overwrite the vanilla files.
